To compile the JavaErlang library it normally suffices to execute 
``configure" and then ``make'' in the main directory.  In the following 
we assume that you are using a UNIX based system:

$ ./configure; make

===============================================

Installation as a normal Erlang library:

===============================================

As an alternative to including the path to the JavaErlang scripts in the
PATH variable, and adding the path to generated JavaErlang.jar file in 
the call to java:start_node/1, one can install JavaErlang as a normal Erlang
library. This method will likely work much better for Windows
installations of JavaErlang as well. 
Steps:

1. Compile JavaErlang as above, and then
   make release

2. Install JavaErlang as a library:
   cd release/java_erlang_version*

   erl
   1> java_erlang_install:install().

For the last step to work, it may be necessary to start Erlang (erl)
with super-user rights (under Unix) or administrator rights (Windows).

More information regarding how to install JavaErlang as a library,
including from a pre-compiled JavaErlang distribution, can be found in
the file bininst/INSTALLATION.

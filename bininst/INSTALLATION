INSTALLATION
============

The easiest way of using the JavaErlang library is by installing it as a normal
Erlang library.

To install JavaErlang in the normal Erlang directory structure
type the line

``java_erlang_install:install().''

to the Erlang shell. Erlang should be started from the same directory
as this file ("INSTALLATION"). That is,

> erl

Erlang R14B03 (erts-5.8.4) [source] [smp:2:2] [rq:2] [async-threads:0] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]

Eshell V5.8.4  (abort with ^G)
1> java_erlang_install:install().
...

You will probably have to run erlang with super-user priviliges 
(under Unix/Linux) or administrator privileges (Windows) for
the installation to succeed.       

After restarting Erlang, you can verify the status of the 
JavaErlang installation by typing:

> java_erlang_version:version().

in the Erlang shell.

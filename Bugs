Bugs:


- string_to_list() fails for non-ascii Java strings.

Workaround: use string_to_utf8 instead, although note that it returns a binary.


- Due to changes in Java 9 (the introduction of the module system)
there may be problems with reflection.

For instance, to permit method access
in Java inner class the library has to call method.setAccessible(true)
due to a Java bug 4071957; in Java 9 (and higher) this may fail.
Note that this is an instance of deep reflection.

An example error message:

Unable to make java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass accessible: module java.base does not "opens java.lang" to unnamed module @1941a8ff

Workaround:

Require java to "open" the module and package combination from the error
message:

java:start_node([{java_options,["--add-opens","java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED"]}]).

Starting java in this way ensures that the java runtime is started with the java.lang package open for (deep) reflection.

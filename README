JavaErlang is a library that attempts to facilitate the communication
between Java and Erlang nodes, implemented as an additional layer on
top of the JInterface Java interface.

Consult the edoc documentation for more information regarding the
library. Some simple eunit tests for the library are available
in src/tests.erl, and tests/hashset_test.erl illustrates how to
test a Java library (java.util.HashSet) using JavaErlang 
and the Quviq QuickCheck tool (www.quviq.org).

1. Handling of gc() could work a bit better.
   We should do an asynchronous call (send) to Java with deallocated
   references, and make sure that the call is only made when the Java
   side is still alive.

2. Symbolic names should probably really provide a symbolic name for Java.

3. Permit compilation of a dynamic library on Macintosh.
   Also: notice if compilation of a dynamic library is possible,
   and if not, remark on this, but still permit compilation of the library.

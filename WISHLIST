- string_to_list does not do the correct thing for non-ascii data.
  A list of bytes are returned, which since they are signed, may be
  negative and thus crash Erlang.

- It is probably better to move tga analysis wholly to Java.

- Provide a nice pretty printer for Java classes, for debugging purposes.

- Program an interface to permit easy access to non-public
  fields, methods (and maybe classes).

  Idea:
	start_node
	([{permit_access_to,
   	   [{'Cl1',{method,'name'},{field,'name'},{class,'class'}}]
	  }]).

We add this information to the node, and then in acquire_class we lookup
the node and send along such information to java_to_erlang who forwards
the information to java.

- string_to_list does not do the correct thing for non-ascii data.
  A list of bytes are returned, which since they are signed, may be
  negative and thus crash Erlang.

- It is probably better to move tga analysis wholly to Java.

- Provide a nice pretty printer for Java classes, for debugging purposes.

- Program an interface to permit easy access to non-public
  fields and methods.

  Idea:
	start_node([{inside_classes,['Cl1']}])

This declaration means that all declared methods and declared fields
in CL1 will become visible to JavaErlang.

We add this information to the node, and then in acquire_class we lookup
the node and send along such information to java_to_erlang who forwards
the information to java.

Note however that we have to make sure this works with classes
rewritten using Javassist. Maybe we can add an option to acquire_class as
a hint which is the original class name.

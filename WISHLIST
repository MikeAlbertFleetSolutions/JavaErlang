- With the introduction of modules in Java 9 some reflection operations
are no longer allowed. For instance, to permit method access
in Java inner class we had to call method.setAccessible(true)
due to a Java bug 4071957. This is no longer possible
without taking some work arounds.

- string_to_list does not do the correct thing for non-ascii data.
  A list of bytes are returned, which since they are signed, may be
  negative and thus crash Erlang:
  we will introduce a string_to_utf8 function.

- It is probably better to move tga analysis wholly to Java.

- Provide a nice pretty printer for Java classes, for debugging purposes.

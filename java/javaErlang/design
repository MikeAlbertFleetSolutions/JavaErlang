At Java we had two tables:
   ref -> {tag, Key_as_int, Node_id}
   {tag, Key_as_int, Node_id} -> ref

We change this to:
   ref -> [[Counter,FreeKeys,Key_as_int,Node_id]]
   {Key_as_int,Node_id} -> ref
and we communicate to Erlang the extended reference:
    {tag,Key_as_int,CounterValue,Node_id},
and increase the FreeKeys count,
but probably coded as a Java key since we anyway have to take apart the
key that comes from Erlang.

At Erlang we have to analyse the incoming data, to change keys into
keys with references.

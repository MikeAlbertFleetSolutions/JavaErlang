11/2 -- 2014:

JavaErlang now has support for garbage collection of Java objects passed
to Erlang. This is (for now) disabled by default, to enable it use the
option {gc_enable,true} (an option to java:start_node/1).

Due to the support for garbage collection it is no longer safe to
check whether two Java object references in Erlang are equal using normal
Erlang term equality ("=="); the function java:eq/2 should be used instead.

21/11 -- 2012:

The code for generating an Erlang module corresponding to
a Java class has been removed in this version of the library.
Thus, Java objects can be created and accessed only
using the functions exported from the ``java'' module.

Java nodes can now be started on remote Erlang nodes --
see the options for the ``java:start_node/1'' function.


15/09 -- 2011: 
      First public release of the JavaErlang library.

21/11 -- 2012:

The code for generating an Erlang module corresponding to
a Java class has been removed in this version of the library.
Thus, Java objects can be created and accessed only
using the functions exported from the ``java'' module.

Java nodes can now be started on remote Erlang nodes --
see the options for the ``java:start_node/1'' function.


15/09 -- 2011: 
      First public release of the JavaErlang library.

JavaErlang requires rebar3 (http://www.rebar3.org) for building and
testing.  See http://www.rebar3.org/v3.0/docs/getting-started for
getting started with rebar3.

To compile, execute the following command:

```
$ rebar3 compile
```

To test, execute the following command:

```
$ rebar3 eunit -v
```

If the eunit tests timeout, try re-running the test to see if the
timeout repeats.


To generate Markdown docs, execute the following command:

```
$ env ERL_LIBS=$PWD/_build/default/lib/edown rebar3 edoc
```

Installation as a normal Erlang library:

===============================================

As an alternative to including the path to the JavaErlang scripts in the
PATH variable, and adding the path to generated JavaErlang.jar file in
the call to java:start_node/1, one can install JavaErlang as a normal Erlang
library. This method will likely work much better for Windows
installations of JavaErlang as well.
Steps:

1. Compile JavaErlang as above, and then
   make release

2. Install JavaErlang as a library:
   cd release/java_erlang_version*

   erl
   1> java_erlang_install:install().

For the last step to work, it may be necessary to start Erlang (erl)
with super-user rights (under Unix) or administrator rights (Windows).

More information regarding how to install JavaErlang as a library,
including from a pre-compiled JavaErlang distribution, can be found in
the file bininst/INSTALLATION.
